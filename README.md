<h3>Q1. Implement Round robin scheduling algorithm with quanta 3.</h3>
<p>
Round Robin is the pre-emptive process scheduling algorithm.
Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum.
Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process executes for a given time period.
Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes.

In this program, I have simulated the Round robin algorithm with sample inputs.
value of quantum = 3

<h3>Q2.Demonstation of fork()</h3>

<p>
In this program parent and child run same codes and parent process is executed first
